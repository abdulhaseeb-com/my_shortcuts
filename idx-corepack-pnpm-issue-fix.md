Hitting the **EROFS (Read-Only File System)** error because **Corepack is trying to create symlinks in `/usr/bin/`, which is not writable in Google Cloud Shell (IDX)**.

## **✅ Fix: Install and Use `pnpm` Without Corepack**
Since `corepack enable` is failing due to file system restrictions, let's **install `pnpm` manually** instead of relying on Corepack.

### **1️⃣ Install `pnpm` Manually**
```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

### **2️⃣ Add `pnpm` to Your PATH**
```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/pnpm:$PATH"
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/pnpm:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### **3️⃣ Verify `pnpm` Installation**
```sh
pnpm -v
```
If successful, it will output the installed version of `pnpm`.

## **🔍 Why This Works?**
✅ **Avoids modifying `/usr/bin/` (which is read-only in Google IDX)**  
✅ **Installs `pnpm` directly in your home directory**  
✅ **Works without needing `corepack enable`**  

Since **Corepack isn't essential** for using `pnpm`, this manual installation method is the best approach. Try this and let me know if it works! 🚀
